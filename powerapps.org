* canvas app 
custom apps with drag and drop features and formulas
starts with user experience
best for role, or task based apps and users who care about UI and connecting to data sources other than dataverse

lot of data sources to connect to (around 1200) one of those datasource is dataverse

* model driven app
data centric apps which creates UI based on dataverse tables
starts with the underlying database or datastructure, data model, relationships, business processes
mostly forms and lists
there are many functionalities available in model-driven apps which we didn't ask for too. unlike in canvas apps, in which "What You See Is What You Get"

* Power apps for teams

building power apps within(inside) teams
uses dataverse but identical to canvas app
users will use teams to access apps and developers will use teams to build the app
upto 1M rows and 2GB data

* Power pages(or called portals)
